  about: [
    "I founded Yom Health with a clear mission: to improve access to quality healthcare services across Ghana and beyond. As a founder, I've learned that building a health-tech platform isn't just about writing code—it's about understanding real-world problems, coordinating diverse teams, and creating solutions that truly make a difference.",
    "From conceptualizing the platform to leading product strategy, managing stakeholder relationships, and navigating legal compliance, I've built Yom Health from the ground up. Our platform connects patients with verified healthcare professionals for home-based and on-demand care, using real-time GPS proximity matching and secure authentication systems.",
    "Beyond the technology, I'm passionate about creating impact. Every feature we build, every decision we make, is guided by one question: How does this improve healthcare access for people who need it most?",
