  about: [
    "I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things that work—and work well. Whether it's a complex healthcare platform, a location-based social app, or a client's business website, I approach every project with the same commitment to clean code, scalable architecture, and excellent user experience.",
    "My technical journey spans frontend frameworks like React and Next.js, backend systems with Django and Python, and real-time features using WebSockets and Firebase. I've built authentication systems, RESTful APIs, GPS-based matching algorithms, and everything in between.",
    "I hold an MSc in Information Technology from BlueCrest University College, where my thesis explored blockchain-based security for edge computing. Beyond my own products, I've delivered freelance work for notable organisations including GIZ, Africa Women in Agribusiness (AWIA), Guzakuza, YoYo Ride, Pisca Sports, and Romsj Global Tech.",
